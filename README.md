Summary

We are looking to use various ML techniques to predict length of stay. 
at hospitals. 

Our dataset is the 2010 National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey, collected by the National Center for Health
Statistics. This annual survey samples physician-paient interactions across
the US. Sampling was done using a "multi-stage probability design". For more information, please consult pdfs/docs2010.pdf.
